# Useful scripts [In progress]

This repository contains useful scripts that I have written. They are not big enough to be a 
separate repository, but they are theoretically useful and I use them from time to time.

## Installation

clone this project:

```
git clone git@github.com:trudy418/useful-scripts.git
```

## List of scripts

- generate-random - Generate random passwords, IP addresses, MAC addresses in Python.

## Plan

- graphics and functions - ???
- shapes - operations and visualization with shapes.
- vectors - operations and visualization with vectors.
