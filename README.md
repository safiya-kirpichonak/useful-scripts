# Usefll scripts

This repository contains useful scripts that I have written. They are not big enough to be a 
separate repository, but they are theoretically useful.

## Installation

clone this project:

```
git clone git@github.com:trudy418/usefull-scripts.git
```

## Content

- generate_random - generate random passwords, IP addresses, MAC addresses, etc.
